      <description>Not in my Backyard In 2013, an abandoned train station in a wealthy neighborhood of Paris is about to be replaced by a block of council flats despite the loud opposition of its neighbors. A few weeks before the works begin, I went there to immortalize this urban wasteland, symbol of the class war in the 16th arrondissement.

      <description>Confiture Confiture (which means “jam” in French) is a project for a periodical publication focusing on social, cultural and visual studies. It aims at analysing popular cultural practices in the present world and societies. Each issue is dedicated to a different question such as cultural legitimacy, digital communities or matters of representation in pop culture. The title refers to a French idiomatic expression basically saying that the less one knows, the more one brags about.</description>

      <description>Image manquante Going through my archives, I selected the negatives of photographs that didn’t come out. Labelled as failed by the photo laboratory, they were not printed. By scanning and enlarging them, I gave them an existence.
